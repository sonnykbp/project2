# PROJECT 2: WHISK!

Whisk! is a baking recipe sharing full stack rails application. All users are able to browse all recipes and reviews. But registered users can upload their own recipes and save others to their favorites.  

# TECHNOLOGIES

-Rails
-Ruby
-Bootstrap

# APPROACH

Started by mapping out the ERD for all the models and their relations. I planned out different levels for MVP, Silver and Gold. Then I set up the app in rails and test with dummy seed. I finish all CRUD/REST routes for Dessert, Recipe and Favorite models. Then I added User and Review models. Then added user authentication, validation, flashes and error handling. Once I completed all the REST functionality for all models, I started styling with Bootstrap.

# UNSOLVED PROBLEMS

- App is not fully mobile responsive.
- Bug in the form. Every time you edit recipe, the ingredient section adds extra string characters "[]" and "/" to the list.
